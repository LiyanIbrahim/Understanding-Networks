I think this week's assignment was relatively straightforward but for the first part of the exercise of setting up nginx as a web server, it worked but the last part of the exercise in which we were setting up server blocks didn’t work super well for me. While the terminal part of the exercise was fine and i think i did everything right and my terminal was not giving me errors, i couldn’t load just the page with just liyanib.com

Another thing is me getting this error and when I googled it, it said that the domain should be under type A but my domain is under type A so I’m not really sure why I’m getting this error.  </br>
