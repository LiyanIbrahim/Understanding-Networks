While I have definitely spent a lot of time taking formal coding classes, I think I lack a lot of understanding on the fundamentals of coding, especially web based coding . It was mainly self taught so it’s taking me a minute to understand in depth how it works fundamentally. 
</br> </br> 
I used node.js in my pcomp final project because I wanted to connect arduino with p5 with dalle so we figured the best way to do that is using express.js and while it did work (still surprised), I didn’t truly understand how or the fundamentals of it. </br> 
So for this weeks assignment, I really wanted to do that but I also wanted to try to connect my website with a weather API and have it change colors based on the weather.

Downloading nodejs and creating a project directory for it:

I then got an API key from https://openweathermap.org/api and wrote HTML, CSS and JS files into the same project directory. I used nano on temrinal to write them but I still need to remember the name of the editor shown in class where I can just drag and drop files since the terminal editor is really annoying. 
</br> 

After writing an API key and writing the code, I was kind of unsure with one thing. So I logged into my digital ocean server host and that’s where I installed everything and got my project directly going in there

But in the code and in my previous experience doing with node.js, I’d identify a local host port that it would run on and so I kind of did that and it would run on the terminal but I really can’t seem to locate it. I assume that, code wise, I did everything right because I was not getting errors but I think I still lack some structural understanding of where everything is which is making debugging this harder than I thought.
