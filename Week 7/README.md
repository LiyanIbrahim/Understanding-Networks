While I have definitely spent a lot of time taking formal coding classes, I think I lack a lot of understanding on the fundamentals of coding, especially web based coding . It was mainly self taught so it’s taking me a minute to understand in depth how it works fundamentally. 
</br> </br> 
I used node.js in my pcomp final project because I wanted to connect arduino with p5 with dalle so we figured the best way to do that is using express.js and while it did work (still surprised), I didn’t truly understand how or the fundamentals of it. </br> 
So I really wanted to do that but I also wanted to try to connect my website with a weather API and have it change colors based on the weather. 
</br> 
After writing an API key and writing the code, I was kind of unsure with one thing. So I logged into my digital ocean server host and that’s where I installed everything and got my project directly going in there 
</br> 



But in the code and in my previous experience doing with node.js, I’d identify a local host port that it would run on and so I kind of did that and it would run on the terminal but I really can’t seem to locate it. I assume that, code wise, I did everything right because I was not getting errors but I think I still lack some structural understanding of where everything is which is making debugging this harder than I thought.
