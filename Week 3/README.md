For this assignment, I decided to start simple then later expand since I do want to try to enclose the controller. For my PCOMP final project last year, I made a type of controller that communicates with p5js and then sends prompts to Dalle and then Dalle sends the images back and so I really wanted to create an enclosed controller. I also wanted to have part of the controller be non-gamer user friendly so I wanted to print out the directions and stick them to the buttons. I didn’t stick them on yet because I do want to enclose it first but I laser printer and engraved the buttons I want to use. </br>
I had some questions about the code and networks part of it that were answered during office hours but I’m adding those in here for documentation purposes and for my future reference.

<b>Confusion 1. IP address distinction  <b> </br>

Two types of IP addresses used in this assignment: </br>
</br>Server IP address --  ifconfig -- 10.18.241.74 is this right? Does it depend on where I ran ifconfig from ?? </br>
