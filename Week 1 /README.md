For this week's assignment, the hardest part for me was I would say mainly the setup. I’m not sure if it was because I’m running Bash and that computes a different output than what is in the tutorial but for the most part I got the setup up and running. 
I ran into an issue where I had my firewall up and I quit terminal but wasn’t able to log back in and I had to go to DigitalOcean and reset my password and then log back in </br>

Another issue I ran into was when I was analyzing my firewall logs, all the commands worked but for some reason, sudo head -1/var/log ufw.log would not read. This is the error I got:

Another issue I had is that when the server broke? (Broken pipe) and I tried to log back in, I got this error:

The github student developer package also did not end up going through and my application is still being processed and so after waiting for a while, I just ended up signing up for digital ocean and so I did not leave the firewall up for too long but here are some entries I found.
