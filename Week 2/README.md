I initially started by reading the additional introduction to the traceroute function and based on this: </br>
“The Traceroute command (Tracert on Windows) is a small network diagnostic software that you have built-in on your device and servers for tracing the route, hop by hop to a target”.
</br></br>
My basic understanding of it is that you can track whoever is trying to access the inserted website through hops until you reach a target IP address. 
</br></br>
I then tried to traceroute a couple of random websites such as google and instagram just to make sure it worked and throughout I noticed that sometimes the hops skip a couple lines before tracing another IP address and I don’t fully understand why. </br>
I decided to try tracing two main websites and mapping them: 1. Itp’s website (itp.nyu.edu) and 2. IP address website (ipinfo.io) 
</br></br>
For ITP’s Website: </br>
1. Main results from terminal: </br>
2. Map of results: </br>
3. Some notes: I plugged in one of the IP addresses onto ipinfo.io and noticed it was coming from digital oceans website which made me a little confused. I’m not sure if this just means that digitalocean provided the domain or if it’s because I was signed into my digital ocean website </br>
</br></br>

For IP address website:</br>
1. Main results from terminal:  </br>
2. Map of the results: </br>
